# DAI-2022-SMTP

## About this project
The prupose of this project is to get familiar with the SMTP (Simple Message Transfer Protocol), JAVA TCP Socket API and docker.
For that, we are going to implement a MockMock server (SMTP server) with docker. Then we are going to create our own client application in JAVA. It will use TCP to create a socket API in order to communicate with the MockMock server and generate partial SMTP requests.

## What is MockMock ?
