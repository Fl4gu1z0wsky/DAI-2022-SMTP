# DAI-2022-SMTP

## About this project
The prupose of this project is to get familiar with the SMTP (Simple Message Transfer Protocol), JAVA TCP Socket API and docker.
For that, we are going to implement a MockMock server (SMTP server) with docker. Then we are going to create our own client application in JAVA. It will use TCP to create a socket API in order to communicate with the MockMock server and generate partial SMTP requests.

## What is MockMock ?
MockMock is a cross-platform SMTP server built on Java. It allows you to test if outgoing emails are sent (without actually sending them) and to see what they look like. It provides a web interface that displays which emails were sent and shows you what the contents of those emails are. If you use MockMock you can be sure that your outgoing emails will not reach anyone by accident. Thus, it is a good plateform to test your SMTP code.
